Master Plan:

INTRO:

After some time online and some problems encountered with the current setup, a new version of looklala13 is going to be implemented.

FIRST STEP:

- Create a Hub landing page, ala looklala09 , that redirects the final purchase to the merchant engine store.

- On this first step, create with the clean theme a carrusel, followed by the tshirts we want to show...
