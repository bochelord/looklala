Master Plan:

INTRO:

After some time online and some problems encountered with the current setup, a new version of looklala13 is going to be implemented. For marketing purposes we'll start with the girl focus and then: gamer girl, music girl, indie girl, geek girl. Obviously there's room for the male version of the things, but our preference is the female market.
Also the little kid one , as well. More like kukuxumusu image than other thing. 


FIRST STEP:

- Create a Hub landing page, ala looklala09 , that redirects the final purchase to the merchant engine store.

- On this first step, create with the clean theme a carrusel, followed by the tshirts we want to show...

- It should connect to the shop in generic mode for each tshirt
